    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is hands down the most delicious Spicy Mayo recipe I have ever had! Similar to the <a href="jerk-chicken-burgers.html">Jerk Chicken Burgers</a>, this recipe comes from the cookbook <em>Eat Delicious</em> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dennistheprescott/" >Chef Dennis Prescott</a>.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large free-range egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1.75 cups sunflower oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
        <li>0.25 teaspoon sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and the mustard (see Tip below). While whisking continuously, slowly stream the oil into the egg yolks a little at a time until completely emulsified. This will take 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the mayonnaise has come together and is nice and thick, add the lemon juice, vinegar, and hot sauce and whisk for 30 seconds. Fold in the grated garlic and herbs and season with the salt. Taste and adjust the seasonings if necessary.</li>
        <li>You just made mayo! It'll keep in an airtight container in the fridge for about 1 week. If it separates, add 1-2 teaspoons water to the mayo and whisk until smooth and combined.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> <em>Set the bowl on a damp cloth for your whisking session. This will help the bowl stay put and make your whisking life much, much easier.</em></p>
